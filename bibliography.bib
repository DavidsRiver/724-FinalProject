  abstract={The Real Business Cycle (RBC) research program has grown spectacularly over the last decade, as its concepts and methods have diffused into mainstream macroeconomics. Yet, there is increasing skepticism that technology shocks are a major source of business fluctuations. This chapter exposits the basic RBC model and shows that it requires large technology shocks to produce realistic business cycles. While Solow residuals are sufficiently volatile, these imply frequent technological regress. Productivity studies permitting unobserved factor variation find much smaller technology shocks, suggesting the imminent demise of real business cycles. However, we show that greater factor variation also dramatically amplifies shocks: a RBC model with varying capital utilization yields realistic business cycles from small, nonnegative changes in technology.},

  abstract={ The time-series literature reports two stylized facts about output dynamics in the United States: GNP growth is positively autocorrelated and GNP appears to have an important trend-reverting component. This paper investigates whether current real-business-cycle models are consistent with these stylized facts. Many real-business-cycle models have weak internal propagation mechanisms and must rely on external sources of dynamics to replicate both facts. Models that incorporate labor adjustment costs are partially successful. They endogenously generate positive autocorrelation in output growth but they need implausibly large transitory shocks to match the trend-reverting component in output.

@BOOK{torres,
title = {Introduction to Dynamic Macroeconomic General Equilibrium Models},
author = {Torres, Jose},
year = {2015},
edition = {2},
publisher = {Vernon Art and Science Inc},
abstract = {This book offers an introductory step-by-step course in Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) modelling. Modern macroeconomic analysis is increasingly concerned with the construction, calibration and/or estimation and simulation of DSGE models. The book is intended for graduate students as an introductory course to DSGE modelling and for those economists who would like a hands-on approach to learning the basics of modern dynamic macroeconomic modelling. The book starts with the simplest canonical neoclassical DSGE model and then gradually extends the basic framework incorporating a variety of additional features, such as consumption habit formation, investment adjustment cost, investment-specific technological change, taxes, public capital, household production, non-ricardian agents, monopolistic competition, etc. The book includes Dynare codes for the models developed that can be downloaded from the book’s homepage. The second edition is identical to the first with the exception of a revised appendix to Chapter 2. The revised appendix can be downloaded free of charge in the accompanying downloads section.},

abstract = { This paper develops and estimates a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with sticky prices and wages for the euro area. The model incorporates various other features such as habit formation, costs of adjustment in capital accumulation and variable capacity utilization. It is estimated with Bayesian techniques using seven key macroeconomic vari-ables: GDP, consumption, investment, prices, real wages, employment, and the nominal interest rate. The introduction of ten orthogonal structural shocks (including productivity, labor supply, investment, preference, cost-push, and monetary policy shocks) allows for an empirical investigation of the effects of such shocks and of their contribution to business cycle fluctuations in the euro area. Using the estimated model, we also analyze the output (real interest rate) gap, defined as the difference between the actual and model-based potential output (real interest rate).

author = {Uribe, Martín and Schmitt-Grohé, Stephanie},

type = {Computing in Economics and Finance 2005},

abstract = { In this paper we study optimal fiscal and monetary rules in a medium-scale estimated model of the U.S. business cycle. The model features several real and nominal rigidities that have been identfied in the recent literature as salient in explaining observed aggregate fluctuations. The government is assumed to conduct stabilization policy through the use of fiscal and monetary policy instruments. The fiscal instruments are capital and labor income tax rates, the monetary instrument is the nominal interest rate. The paper first characterizes Ramsey steady states. (Contrary to earlier papers that study optimal capital income taxation in models with imperfect competition, we find that the optimal capital income subsidy is not just equal to the markup but about 4 times larger. The reason for this discrepancy is that earlier papers abstracted from depreciation and the tax deductability of depreciation.) The paper characterizes the dynamic behavior of the economy under the Ramsey equilibrium. These dynamics are then used to find simple fiscal and monetary rules that imply dynamics similar to those induced by the Ramsey equilibrium. Specifically, the parameters of the monetary and fiscal rules are chosen so as to minimize the difference between the impulse responses of key macro aggregates under the Ramsey rule and under simple parametrized monetary and fiscal policy rules. In practise, an important difference between the monetary policy instrument and the fiscal policy instruments is that the nominal interest rate can be adjusted almost instantaneously if needed, whereas tax rates are much less flexible and typically are determined many periods in advance. We model this difference between fiscal and monetary policy instruments by assuming that it takes time to tax. We then ask whether the time-to-tax feature of fiscal policy reduces the power of fiscal instruments to stabilize the economy. The paper also makes some methodological contributions. It shows how to characterize Ramsey equilibria of medium-scale macro models by means of symbolic algebra tools.},

abstract = {A common result from altering several fundamental assumptions of the neoclassical investment model with convex adjustment costs is that investment may occur in lumpy episodes. This paper takes a step back and asks "How lumpy is investment?" We answer this question by documenting the distributions of investment and capital adjustment for a sample of over 13,700 manufacturing plants drawn from over 300 four-digit industries. We find that many plants do undergo large investment episodes; however, there is tremendous variation across plants in their capital accumulation patterns. This paper explores how the variation in capital accumulation patterns vary by observable plant and firm characteristics, and how large investment episodes at the plant level transmit into fluctuations in aggregate investment.
