## RBC model 

\begin{align*}
\max E_0 & \sum^\infty_{t=0} \beta ^t [ \ln (c_t) + \psi \ln(1 - n_t)] \textrm{      s.t.}\\
 y_t &= c_t + i_t \\
 y_t &= A_t k_t^\alpha n_t^{1-\alpha}\\
 k_{t+1} &= i_t + (1-\delta)k_t \\ 
 \ln (A_{t+1}) &= \rho \ln (A_t) + \epsilon_{t+1} \textrm{   where     }\epsilon_{t+1} \sim iid(0, \sigma^2_\epsilon)\\
k_0 \textrm{ and } A_0 & \textrm{ are given and } > 0
\end{align*}
with $\psi > 0,\beta,\delta,\rho \in (0,1)$

**What are the choice variables**

Solve through optimal control. Using the constraints for $y_t$ and $k_t$
\begin{align*}
A_t k_t^\alpha n_t^{1-\alpha} &= c_t +i_t \\
A_t k_t^\alpha n_t^{1-\alpha} &= c_t + k_{t+1}- (1-\delta)k_t\\
0 &= A_t k_t^\alpha n_t^{1-\alpha} - c_t - k_{t+1} + (1-\delta)k_t
\end{align*}
Setting up Lagrange 
\begin{align*}
L &=  E_0 \sum^\infty_{t=0} \beta ^t [ \ln (c_t) + \psi \ln(1 - n_t)]  + \beta^t \lambda_t [ A_t k_t^\alpha n_t^{1-\alpha} - c_t - k_{t+1} + (1-\delta)k_t] \\
\frac{\partial L}{\partial c_t} &: \frac{1}{c_t} = \lambda_t\\
\frac{\partial L}{\partial n_t} &: \frac{\psi}{(1-n_t)} = \lambda_t  \\
&: \frac{\psi}{(1-n_t)} =  \frac{1}{c_t}[(1-\alpha)\frac{y_t}{n_t}]\\
\frac{\partial L}{\partial k_{t+1}} &: \lambda_t = \lambda_{t+1} \beta [\alpha \frac{y_{t+1}}{k_{t+1}} + (1-\delta)]\\
&:  \frac{1}{c_t} =  \frac{1}{c_{t+1}} \beta  [\alpha \frac{y_{t+1}}{k_{t+1}} + (1-\delta)] 
\end{align*}

** Need to solve for steady state**

Solving the investment adjustment costs model. The model will follow the same specification as "Shapiro (86) The Dynamic Demand for Capital and Labor"
This model has a change in the production in that changing the capital stock now incurss costs. 

$\ln(y_t) = \ln(f(k_t,n_t,A_t))  - \frac{\alpha_k}{2}[\frac{\delta k_t}{k_{t-1}}]^2$
